// CAPTION, accepted with the build note: Ancient writers give its maker, its bronze and its height of seventy cubits; where it stood, how it posed and what it wore are one reading among several.
// The Colossus of Rhodes: sunrise on a summer festival morning about 275 BC. In at deck height between the mole heads and
// across the great harbour, through the gate of the harbour wall, up a straight climbing avenue with the bronze Helios at
// its head, under the roofed porch of his court and up before him to the height of his chest. The statue and its base are

// BROUGHT IN: cHash, pHash, mHash and fHash, a variant in two components on the constants of Hash without Sine

// (The line was set at round r9's freeze, in comments only, under the owner's section 181: the four stand in r7t
// to the letter, and rounds r8 and r9 brought nothing in.)
//
// ROUNDS r8 AND r9. These lines were written on 16 Oct 2026, before round r9 was frozen and before its deciding
// sheets against r7t were drawn. r7t is the round live as these lines are written; "step A" is round r8's second
// kept step, the file round r9 was built on. The papers named lie under shots/colossus-of-rhodes and design/sw/notes.
//
// SAID FIRST, IN THE STRANGERS' WORDS (the owner's section 180; colossus-r9-ruling.txt, point 4). Of the six strangers
// of round r9's blind preview two named the bales' wrapper in shade on the round's side, at seed 21, u 0.16: "some
// crates in the lower right stack have an odd greenish-grey face beside the orange ones" and "crate stack at right
// has uneven orange and grey-green patches on its faces". Each named the same stack on step A's side of that pair
// too ("blank pale grey crate blocks at lower left and lower right", "crates at far left and at right are flat
// blank grey-white boxes"), so by the rule written before the build no step was booked. It is not mended:
// DEPARTURES a, below. A third stranger named another thing on the round's side, at seed 7, u 0.18: "jars at bottom centre are very dark and partly cut off by the frame edge"; on step A's side of that pair the stranger named the same place ("dark red spiky lump at bottom centre with no jar shapes"), so by the same rule no step was booked. It is not mended either: DEPARTURES e, below.
//
// NOT CURED, SAID BEFORE WHAT THE ROUNDS KEEP:
// - THE STREET'S FLOOR (second on the owner's list after round r7: the dark, plain floor of the street run) IS r7t's
//   TO THE LETTER. Its mean in shade was and is 37.2, 25.8 and 27.9 of 255 at u 0.43, 0.61 and 0.70 (OF THE PICTURE:
//   seed 7, 640 by 360). Round r8 built three forms of a cure and none is in this file. Step F (a thrown light on
//   level ground and a paler worn band) went to four strangers: the step 16, r7t 8, but r7t 3 to 1 at the square
//   (u 0.61). Its four mends (the thrown light by place, modest or fuller; the worn way 1.20 or 1.40 times paler)
//   went blind to twelve strangers, 96 judgements: a mend 34, same 10, r7t 52; at the square r7t 30 of 36; four
//   strangers called the houses' shade broken on a mend's side only (it seemed to end at the kerb or partway down
//   the street); the most modest mend was told from r7t and r7t preferred, 12 to 6. Form W (the worn way as paler
//   stone alone) went to no stranger: to the lead's eye a bar of sun across it at the square stood less strongly
//   than r7t's. What the three taught: light added in the shade takes the dawn out of the square, and one even
//   paler lane reads as laid on the floor (colossus-r8-floor-ruling.txt).
// - NO SOFT SHADE of the sky's light lies under people, posts and things in the street: studied on paper in r8
//   (r8/build/k-study.txt), not built.
// - THE SACKS' FORM IS r7t's. Round r8's step S (the sack as a slumped loaf, a tied sack, bound bales) was built and
//   is NOT kept: of 30 judgements by six strangers it had 25 and step A 1, for its warm colours, but three of the
//   six called its low heap of sacks beside the way pale blank blocks or bare stone, on its side only
//   (colossus-r8-s-ruling.txt). Round r9 takes that step's bale, two lines mended, and leaves its sack: the sacks
//   here are r7t's blocks in a warmer cloth.
// - THE BALCONIES' BRACES whose foot hangs in the air of an open shop mouth (1,402 on seeds 1 to 200, OF THE LAW)
//   are r7t's: two cures were measured in r8 (the brace left out; its foot moved to the jamb) and neither was clean.
//
// WHAT ROUND r8 KEEPS, two steps (its floor steps and its step S are not in this file):
// - H, HOUSEKEEPING AND THE PURSE. NO PIXEL MOVED: 36 of 36 stills equal to r7t's by pixels (seeds 7, 21 and 67).
//   The quay's lots are written from the plan's and the gate round's own lines wherever the sum is the typed number
//   to the last bit; the courts' range ends and the doves' south ring stay typed, and their comments say that no
//   reason by place is known for them; his middle and the line of his jaw are read from the part. TAKEN OUT OF THE
//   DRAWING: the statue's shade (the part's skin for the sun's depth map, 9,737 triangles) is no longer sent to the
//   picture's pass, where it wrote nothing, at any place; and it is cast into the map only while his box meets the
//   sun's box, so that the same 9,737 are no longer sent there in vain. About u 0.13 to 0.21 is where they WERE sent in vain before (the shade lay wholly outside the sun's box there); it is no longer cast there.
//   TYPED: in lifeOf at THE LOTS' MEASURES, at THE SOUTH RING'S FOUR FIGURES and at THE RANGES' ENDS; over DAWN_GLSL
//   at THE BOX'S NUMBERS; over flightOf and in build() (his middle and the line of his jaw read from the part; THE
//   STATUE'S SHADE IS CAST ONLY WHILE HIS BOX MEETS THE SUN'S BOX, set in placeShadow); in the part at its mesh
//   'shade' and at info.looks.
// - A, THE AWNINGS: ONE RULE FOR BOTH STREETS, the lower as the upper. In r7t the cloth of an older shop's awning
//   ran through the floor of its own house's balcony: 711 awnings on seeds 1 to 200 (the lower street 252 of 1,292,
//   the upper 459 of 729; OF THE LAW). Now none does on seeds 1 to 1000: the cloth is cut round the floor by the
//   floor's place, one sheet of 16 triangles as before. AS r7t HAS THEM: the outer edge, the bar, the struts, the
//   dye and the stir, and the braces (above). SAID: an awning whose span ends within 0.15 m of a floor's end, which
//   r7t had clear of the floor, is drawn back 0.15 m clear and its bar's end stands bare; beside a floor's end the
//   slit can be seen close by as a small notch. The rule stands in avenueAfter at THE AWNING AND THE BALCONY.
//
// WHAT ROUND r9 ADDS: THE QUAY AS A WORKING HARBOUR FRONT. Seven steps on step A, all in the one mesh 'harbour front'
// (buildQuayThings, handCart, jarQ, bale; the deal in lifeOf gains only the mark "edge" on the kerb's two small
// lots), each by kind and place: nothing reads the eye, u, the clock or the seed, no stream draws once more or
// less, no call, mesh, material, light or texture is added, and nothing else in the world moves.
// B THE BALES: bound bales in a jute wrapper under tarred girths, the dye of the cloth inside at their two ends,
//   where r7t has pale boxes under cords (the cargo's stacks, the way's lots of three, the landing's lot three high).
// K THE SACKS' CLOTH: r7t's blocks in place and size, in a warmer cloth; the cargo's and the lots' sacks each darker
//   at its foot, a hand cart's three plain.
// J THE JAR STAND AND THE LOTS' JARS: a jar with a neck, a paler lip and a dark mouth; the landing's jars in two
//   tiers stand on a stand of two floors of planks on four posts, twelve below and six above; in a way's lot of ten
//   the two rows stand 0.4 m apart; on stand and lot no jar stands in another (in step A they did, by up to 10.8 cm).
// T THE TIMBER: the landing's baulks are squared, their long faces unbroken (the planks' joints cut step A's into
//   blocks), their sawn ends a step lighter; they and the cargo's stacks of timber stand in the quay's wood.
// C THE HAND CART: in the quay's wood; each wheel a pale disc of planks in its dark tread, the axle's dark end its hub.
// M THE TWO MOORING POSTS AND THE STALL'S FRAME: in the quay's wood (else the darkest things beside the rest).
// W THE SAME JAR ON THE HAND CARTS AND AT THE KERB, WITH ITS PAY: a loaded cart's six jars and the jars of the kerb's
//   two small lots are the necked jar, at five sides; the kerb's 78 mooring stones stand at five sides for six,
//   which pays for them (234 triangles fewer on every seed).
// WHERE EACH STEP IS TYPED (each place carries a comment marked r9): the two colours JUTE and QWOOD in the line of
// colours that holds CLAY and SACK; the two forms jarQ and bale before buildQuayThings. In buildQuayThings, the
// cargo list: B its bales (kind 3), K its sacks (kind 1), T its stacks of timber (kind 2, the last branch), W its
// jars by threes (kind 0, by the lot's mark edge). In buildQuayThings, the way's lots and the landing's: J the jars
// in two rows (kind 0) and the stand (kind 5), K the sacks (kind 1), B the bales by threes (kind 2) and three high
// (kind 8, the last branch), T the baulks (kind 6); after them M the stall's frame and the two mooring posts and W
// the mooring stones. In handCart: C its wood and wheels, K its three sacks, W its six jars. In lifeOf at THE LOTS:
// W the mark edge.
// WHAT IT INVENTS stands below, after round r7's list (OURS, INVENTED: WHAT ROUND r9 TYPES AT THE QUAY).
//
// WHERE ROUND r9 IS SEEN: FROM u 0.00 TO 0.22 ONLY. Against step A (stills of 800 by 450, both sides by one list of
// places in one order; OF THE PICTURE) seed 7 differs in 1,124 of 360,000 pixels at u 0.02, 2,434 at 0.08, 35,684 at
// 0.16, 62,289 at 0.17 (the most) and 4,626 at 0.21; at 0.22 and at every place drawn beyond it, on nine seeds, the
// stills are step A's bytes. Step A's own change against r7t is the awnings of the two streets.
//
// DEPARTURES AND FAULTS OF ROUND r9, SAID, under the letters of colossus-r9-ruling.txt, point 7 (a to e and g are
// not mended; f is):
// a THE BALES' WRAPPER IN SHADE reads greenish grey beside the dyed ends: two of the six strangers named it (seed 21
//   at u 0.16). Each named the same stack on step A's side too, as blank grey blocks, so by the rule written before
//   the build no step was booked; had a thing named on both sides been booked, the bales' step would have stood at
//   two strangers and the round would not be frozen. And a red end in shade goes near black at its foot (seed 2 at
//   u 0.16, the south heap).
// b TWO JAR FORMS ARE IN ONE PICTURE on seeds 2, 21 and 200 at u 0.16: the plain jar of two drums is kept in
//   the cargo list (by the ships, at the wall's foot, in the north heap and the plots beside the way) and, small,
//   on the stalls' boards; the necked jar stands at the kerb, on the hand carts, in the way's lots and on the stand.
//   The lead's rule for step W said "one jar form everywhere at the quay": that is more than the plan types and
//   than this file does. THE SOURCE GOVERNS.
// c THE STAND'S FOUR POSTS PASS THROUGH ITS LOWER FLOOR, which is typed whole (it reads as laid round them); its
//   upper floor lies 10 cm higher than step A's rack, 1.30 m for 1.20, while every jar's top is lower than step A's.
// d THE TIMBER END ON shows nine pale squares that can pass for small blocks (seeds 40, 67, 133 at u 0.14 to 0.16).
//   THE HAND CART'S WHEELS EDGE ON read as upright boards (seed 21 at u 0.16, both wheels of the near cart); step
//   A's read as dark legs there, and neither side reads as a wheel.
// e STEP A'S OWN FAULTS AT THE QUAY, met and not touched: in a stack of six baulks by the ships the third top baulk
//   has nothing under it; three sacks of the heap at the gate's south stall stand partly in the stall's block, on
//   every seed; stacks of timber and jars stand in a tower's wall; goods are cut by the frame's edge at u 0.17 and
//   0.18 (nothing is moved for a still); on seed 7 at u 0.18 a stranger named the round's "jars at bottom centre" as "very dark and partly cut off by the frame edge" (SAID FIRST, above), and to the lead's eye they are dark in the shade and cut by the frame's edge, as step A's lump was (colossus-r9-ruling.txt, point 5).
// f THE COMMENTS THE ADVERSARY OF THE LAWS FOUND FALSE ARE MENDED in this file: the line at JUTE and QWOOD says what
//   each colours and what it does not; the top bale of the lot three high turns "by 10.3" degrees, no longer "by
//   10"; the cargo list's plain jars, sacks and timber are no longer said to lie "by the ships" alone.
// g THE STRANGERS READ THE BALES AS CRATES OF WOOD ("wooden crates", "golden wood with banding"): the round's gain
//   is the goods' colour and form, not the reading "bale". And at 800 by 450 the mooring stones' five sides are not
//   told from six, by the lead's eye and the adversary's.
//
// THE COUNTS (OF THE LAW unless they say the picture):
// - THE HEAVIEST PLACE is seed 197 at u 0.252 to 0.256, where the lens comes through the gate: round r8 found it by
//   a scan of seeds 1 to 200 (round r8's plan had first named seed 200 at u 0.16, 460,577 by the page; the gate's
//   own places miss it). Triangles drawn there, the picture's pass and the sun's map together. BY THE PAGE: r7t
//   466,311, after step H 456,574 (r8/build/h-result.txt); step A and r9 were not counted by the page. BY THE COUNT
//   TOOL (one frame emulated headless), in 129 calls each time: r7t 465,746 (r8/build/verify-h/verdict.txt and
//   counts.txt), after step H and in step A 456,009 (r8/build/h-log.txt, a-result.txt), r9 455,533
//   (r9/build/r9-result.txt; the adversary of the laws and the whole check count the same). THE PURSE IS 470,000:
//   by the page the room was 3,689 in r7t and 13,426 after step H.
// - r9 AGAINST STEP A: the harbour front holds 54 to 238 triangles fewer by seed, never more (a stand 4 fewer, a
//   cart of jars 18 more, a kerb lot of jars 72 more, the stones 234 fewer); at nine places counted on seeds 197,
//   200 and 40 no figure is above step A's and the calls are step A's.
// - No cloth face of a bale or sack is pale: in every built colour blue is under 0.50 of red (the worst 0.471;
//   step A 0.56 to 0.75). The way's lots stand 1.076 m high at most (step A 1.115, over the 1.1 m their rule
//   names); the quay's things keep 2.458 m and more from the flown line (step A 2.416).
// - THE BLIND PREVIEW of round r9 against step A, once, at the quay (OF THE PICTURE): six strangers, seven pairs
//   each, 42 judgements: the round 42 (41 clear, 1 slight), step A 0.
//
// OPEN IN THE CODE, SAID (from r8's checks; none shows in a picture): KNEES, 13 m, is typed here and not read from
// the part, which hands out its knees' height; no reason by place is known for the courts' range ends and the
// doves' south ring; the last look rests on the line of his jaw, 29 m over his soles, and the pit of his throat is
// not taken as a look. Rounds r8 and r9 add no law that reads the eye: the list (a) to (g) below is r7t's.
//
// Axes: +X east, +Z south (north is -Z), +Y up, sea level y 0, the statue's axis at x 0, z 0, the court at y 21.5.
// Everything stands by place: the plan below is world coordinates in metres, and what moves keeps to courses of its own
// on the world clock (ships, walkers, the ox carts, the birds), each laid clear of the flown line by 2 m and more.
// Behind the entry (east of the mole's end on z -14) lies open sea; no ship's course enters that tube.
//
// PLACED SO AS TO BE SEEN WELL FROM THE WAY (each a rule of its place, the same on every seed and at every clock):
// - THE GREAT HARBOUR'S OPEN WATER: no ship rides at anchor inside the mole (the roads and the inner water between the roads'
//   line and the landing are kept open for ships under way). The rule stands at layoutShips.
// - THE GUARD'S LANE (ours): a watch of the harbour's guard rows its round on the festival morning well south of the
//   fairway, out of sight of a ship coming in on the fairway; the whole squadron rows it on a rare visit. The lane's
//   north reach lies two hulls' lengths (72 m) south of the fairway's middle. The rule stands at layoutShips.
// - THE WEST'S CLOUD stands in three fields typed in metres from the avenue's line (his axis running west): tall heaps
//   north of it, low heaps south of it, and a strip of 250 m to either hand kept for low far cloud only, so that from the
//   avenue, the porch and the climb his head and rays stand against sky or low far cloud. The fields stand at BANK.
// - THE LOOKS (where the gaze rests, by place): his chest from the water to the last cross lane, his feet into the porch,
//   his middle from the porch's front until the lens is as high as his knees, the line of his jaw from there on. They
//   stand at flightOf.
// - THE FIRST STREET'S MORNING SHADE is filled by the sky and by the lit roofs (1.8 fold) from the wall's inner face to the
//   first cross lane, so that the wall's long shadow reads as morning shade. The rule stands at DAWN_GLSL.
// - THE GATE ROUND keeps 3.4 m from the axis on the landing's way and 2.2 m in the gate (the middle is the procession's):
//   the festival's people go in by the gate on either hand of the way. THE QUAY'S LOTS lie beside the way to the gate, behind those
//   who stand along it; the gate's guard stands at each pier. The rules stand at lifeOf.
// - THE STORES' COURTS: in each of the avenue's four half blocks below the square one store keeps an open court behind its
//   front range (a garden, a potter's yard, a shrine's court, a dovecote's court), where the line rises over the roofs;
//   on the flat roofs of the avenue's rows and of the rows behind them the bedding is aired over the parapet that looks
//   toward the avenue. The rules stand at lifeOf and roofThings.
// - THE SQUARE'S WEST FRONTS: on the side that each corner house at the head of the upper street turns to the square, the
//   balcony and the shop keep to the wall's end at the avenue's corner. The rule stands at squareSide.
// - THE BIRDS' RINGS AND THE HEARTHS' SMOKE: swallows over the first street's and the upper street's middle, doves over
//   the dovecote and over the square's two hands, up to three hearths' smoke to each block of the avenue's tiled houses.
//   The rings' rule stands at lifeOf (MORE BIRDS), the smokes' in build() (THE HEARTHS OF THE AVENUE'S HOUSES).
// - SHIPS UNDER SAIL FAR OUT: two reaches off the north coast, 1.0 to 1.5 km from the statue, in the sea that opens beside
//   him on the climb. The rule stands at layoutShips.
// - THE DEDICATIONS BESIDE THE WAY'S FOUR TALL TRIPODS (r7): a bronze of the round never stands on a place a tall tripod
//   has taken (2.1 m); it takes the next free place of its own round. Counted on seeds 1 to 200: before this rule a bronze
//   stood within 2.1 m of a tall tripod on 103 seeds, now on none; the bronzes' places change on those 103 seeds and on
//   no other; no tall tripod is moved. The rule stands in build() at tallPlaces.
// - THE MIRROR'S BREAK AND FADE on the harbour go by the mirrored point's height over the water alone (r7).
//
// OURS, INVENTED: WHAT ROUND r7 ADDS TO THE TOWN (the town round him is our reconstruction throughout; none of these has a
// line of research behind it, none stands in the caption or in any text; laid before the owner by name, 12 Oct):
// - in the upper street (metres 250 to 290): more shop mouths with a counter, wares and an awning; small shuttered windows;
//   cloth under sills and on drying poles; pots; painted door frames and bands; sets of jars, sacks and baskets at the
//   wall's foot; a line of cloth over each mouth of the last cross lane; a wall fountain on that lane's north wall.
// - on the quay before the gate (metres 55 to 68): eight lots beside the way (jars in two rows, sacks, corded bales, coils
//   of rope, heaped baskets); three lots at the landing's edge: a RACK OF JARS IN TWO TIERS, BAULKS OF TIMBER ON BEARERS,
//   bales three high; TWO HAND CARTS (plain two-wheeled carts, the ox carts' build made small), one beside a stall's frame
//   under a striped awning; TWO MOORING POSTS of plain timber at the kerb. The rack, the baulks, the hand carts and the
//   posts are new in kind in this town: plain working things of a harbour, nothing lettered, stamped or badged.
//
// OURS, INVENTED: WHAT ROUND r9 TYPES AT THE QUAY (the crew's own forms and numbers, said here by the round's own
// rule; none has a line of research behind it in the round's papers; none is named in the caption; six strangers
// saw them blind, against step A):
// - THE BALES' WRAPPER AND DYES: jute, JUTE [0.7, 0.53, 0.25], with 0.35 of the sacking's colour in it in the way's
//   lots and at the landing; at a bale's two ends the cloth inside, 0.55 of its dye under the wrapper's dust, and
//   0.3 of that dye in the wrapper itself; the dye by the bale's own place: khaki on half the bales, ochre and red
//   on a quarter each (three of the town's cloth dyes); every upright face 0.86 at its foot, the top 1.14; two
//   tarred girths, on the lots' bales a third cord the long way; each bale turned a little, by its place.
// - THE SACKS' CLOTH: half sacking and half jute; the cargo's and the lots' sacks are shaded as the bales are, a
//   hand cart's three are plain blocks in it.
// - THE JAR'S FORM (jarQ), radii and heights as shares of the jar's size s: a foot of 0.05, a belly of 0.2 at 0.58,
//   a neck of 0.07 at 0.76, a lip of 0.095 at 0.98, where the jar ends; the lip's drum 1.45 times paler; the mouth
//   a dark fan. The sizes: 0.86 to 0.96 in a way's lot, 0.84 to 0.90 on the stand's lower floor and 0.81 to 0.88 on
//   its upper, 0.8 on a hand cart, 0.855 to 1.045 at the kerb; five sides on cart and kerb, six in lot and stand.
// - THE STAND'S TWO FLOORS: planks 2.16 by 1.66 m and 6 cm thick, their tops 0.14 m and 1.30 m over the paving, on
//   four posts 9 cm thick. It is the rack of jars in two tiers of round r7's list above, made anew in its own lot.
// - THE COLOUR OF THE TIMBER AND OF THE WORKED WOOD: QWOOD [0.4, 0.29, 0.17], for the cargo's stacks of timber
//   (0.75 to 1.15 of it), the landing's baulks (0.82 to 1.18 of it, their sawn ends 1.2 to 1.45, each times the
//   lot's tone), the stand (its posts 0.7 of its planks), the hand carts (the wheels' discs 1.5 of the cart's tone;
//   tread, axle and hub 0.55 of QWOOD), the stall's frame (0.8) and the kerb's two posts (0.9).
// - THE MOORING STONES' FIVE SIDES: the kerb's 78 stones, six-sided in r7t.
//
// THE LAWS THAT GO BY THE EYE (the owner's section 153; every law of this file that reads the lens stands in this list.
// Each reads WHERE THE EYE IS, whichever lens draws; none reads where it looks but (d), which leaves out only what lies
// outside the picture; none reads a place of the route, a seed or the clock):
// (a) PLAIN PEOPLE ARE DRAWN IN FEWER FACES FROM 60 m AND FROM 120 m FROM THE EYE: a quarter's grown people who carry
//     nothing stand as the plainer figure while the eye is more than 60 m from their quarter's bounds and as the
//     plainest beyond 120 m; those who carry or hold something as the plainest beyond 120 m; the same people at the
//     same places and step. The rule stands in build() at LOD and in update().
// (b) THE MIRROR ON THE HARBOUR'S WATER IS LAID BY THE EYE'S PLACE (what a mirror does): every point of the plain
//     bodies (the hulls, the great quay's face, the harbour wall) is turned down under the sea's level and laid where
//     the straight line from the eye to that mirrored point meets the water; the image is as strong as water mirrors
//     at the slant from the water to the eye, and it wavers square to the eye's bearing. The rule stands at
//     mirrorMaterial.
// (c) THE COURT'S INNER PEOPLE (those who keep west of x 24) ARE NOT DRAWN WHILE THE EYE IS EAST OF THE HARBOUR WALL'S
//     INNER FACE (x 290) AND UNDER THE COURT'S FLOOR (y 21.5). East of the wall the way keeps low (5.2 m up at most:
//     the water, the quay, the gate), and from there the straight line from the eye over the east lip of the porch's
//     floor (x 64) passes 2.3 m and more over the paving at x 24, and higher further west. The typed bound is plainer
//     and wider than that line: an eye east of the wall and close under the court's floor would find them not drawn;
//     no place of the way lies there. The rule stands in build() at THE COURT'S INNER PEOPLE and in update().
// (d) NOT IN THE PICTURE, NOT DRAWN: the harbour front and each ship, with her mirror image, foam, wake, oars and
//     pennant, by the eye's own frustum (the renderer's own rule for every bounded mesh, kept here for what the
//     renderer cannot judge). The rule stands in build() at frontBoxes and placeShips and in update().
// (e) THE HAZE BETWEEN THE EYE AND A PLACE is a medium: the city's, the things', the people's and the mirror's

  // coils of rope, baskets, baulks of timber, a hand cart, a stall's frame). A LOT IS A PLACE OF THE QUAY'S PLAN, the
  // same on every visit; what lies in it is dealt from the kinds by a stream of its own ('quay-way-lots': no older
  // stream is drawn on, and nobody is added, moved or thinned for a lot).
  //   THE WAY'S LOTS: along each edge of the middle way from the landing to the gate, inside the gate round's two
  //   lines (3.4 m from the axis), four lots on each hand: each 2.3 m long and 0.84 m deep, its face to the way 1.98 m
  //   from the axis and its back 0.58 m inside the walkers' line, 0.4 m between two, from x 302.5 (where the round's lines begin to close on the gate: the gate's
  //   passage and the 6.5 m before it stay clear) to x 312.9 (the round's turn is at x 313.6). Goods no higher
  //   than 1.1 m: the lens goes over the middle 2.8 m and more above the quay there.
  //   THE LANDING'S LOTS: on the quay's edge strip east of the round's turn (x 314.5 to 316.9), beside the two small
  //   lots that always lay there: north of the way one lot 2.3 m off the lens's line and one beyond the old lot; south
  //   of it one lot between the way and the old lot (south of that the porters go). Taller goods: jars stacked in
  //   two tiers, baulks, a loaded hand cart, bales three high; each place takes another kind. The far north place
  //   may be a knot's standing place on some visits: the deal asks, and a taken place is left bare.
  //   THE FRAME: a stall's frame under its awning, and a hand cart with its shafts down beside it, in the band
  //   behind the north crowd (between its backs, 6.6 m from the axis, and the round's back line, 9.8 m); on the south
  //   hand that band is the porters' lane, and nothing stands in it.
  //   TWO MOORING POSTS at the kerb, 2.2 m to each hand of the landing's middle (the fairway's end, z -1).
  //   THE LOTS' MEASURES (r8): the places below are written from the plan's and the gate round's own lines wherever
  //   the sum comes out the very number r7 typed, to the last bit. A lot's place feeds the hash that tones and sizes

// THE UPPER STREET'S FULLER HAND (r7; ours, all invented; the kinds are the avenue's own from lower down: a shop's mouth

// upper street (the avenue's two blocks above the square, on both hands) takes sixteen numbers from its row's own NEW
// stream ('upper-street:' and the row's name; no older stream is drawn on, so every older thing stands as it stood),
// used or not, and by them and by the front's own place, side and storey:
//   GROUND STOREY. A front that was dealt no shop opens one where a free stretch of wall is 2.6 m and more (free:
//   0.7 m in from the front's ends and 0.7 m off every dealt opening), in eight fronts of ten: in the longest such
//   stretch that is clear of the front's balcony, else in the longest: there, under a balcony or gallery that covers
//   the whole mouth, the awning hangs from the floor's front edge on two poles; under one that covers a part of it,
//   no awning but a valance of the shop's cloth from the floor's edge. A mouth of up to
//   3.8 m in that stretch's middle, its counter and wares as the lower street's, its awning on two poles 1.9 m out (the
//   low zone's kind: the poles stand between the foot way's standers, 4.75 m from the axis, and the walkers' third
//   line, 3.55 m) or on struts 2.0 m out (its edge 4.0 m from the axis: outside that line), by turns of the deal. Every other free stretch of 1.7 m and more has a small
//   window high in its middle (1.9 to 2.5 m up, as the lane sides have), shut or open.
//   UPPER STOREY. From an open window a long dyed cloth hangs under the sill (five in ten), or a drying pole stands
//   out 1.55 m over the foot way with two cloths on it (three in ten), or a pot of green stands on the sill; under a
//   shut window a cloth hangs in five of ten. A cloth ends above whatever stands under it (a balcony's rail, an
//   awning, the storey's course); where less than 0.7 m is left there is none; no pole stands out over a balcony.
// upperAfter builds these and, by the front's place alone (no stream): a course of plaster along the upper windows'
// sills; one painted line more to every front (a frieze under the storey's course on the fronts that carry no band
// over the dado, a band under the sills' course on those that do); a painted frame round every house door; and at
// the wall's foot in each stretch the older deal left bare a set of jars, baskets, sacks or a bench (nothing of it
// further than 0.8 m from the wall: the standers' line is 1.25 m out).

// ripple at every height, the more the higher the mirrored point stands over the water, and fades to half with that

// THE MORNING'S CLOUD IN THE WEST: the night's cloud has drawn off inland and stands over the land west of the court; the
// rising sun takes its eastern faces. The stream 'cloud-fields' deals its heaps into THREE FIELDS typed in metres: how
// far west of the statue's axis a heap's middle stands, and how far to each hand of THE AVENUE'S LINE (the axis running
// due west through him) the heap may reach. A heap lies whole between its field's two edges to the line's hand (its
// middle is dealt so that its own reach, 1.18 of its breadth, stays inside them): no dealt place is ever refused, and
// the stream 'cloud-bank' deals the heaps' forms. The cloud does not drift.
//   THE NORTH FIELD: middles 1,450 to 2,150 m west, the heaps between 250 m and 2,100 m north of the line. Six TALL
//     heaps (340 to 680 m broad, their feet 265 to 395 m up): the bank's body, over the low ground and the bay. No
//     place of the flown line lies south of the avenue's line, so his head never stands before this field.
//   THE SOUTH FIELD: middles 1,450 to 2,150 m west, the heaps between 250 m and 1,700 m south of the line. Six LOW
//     heaps (220 to 320 m broad, their feet 90 to 130 m up, their tops under 405 m): the bank's tail over the
//     island's hills. On the climb the lens leaves the line northward and rises to his chest, and his head then stands
//     before the south western sky, lower with every metre: this field's cloud stays under it.
//   THE STRIP, 250 m to either hand of the line, is kept for LOW FAR CLOUD ONLY: three small heaps whose middles stand
//     3,200 to 3,800 m west, between 600 m north and 600 m south of the line (200 to 300 m broad, their feet 60 to
//     110 m up, their tops under 385 m): the lowest and the farthest cloud of the three fields. From the harbour's
//     entry (384 m east of his axis, 2.6 m over the water) their tops stand 6.1 degrees up at most: the height of his
//     waist from there, under his chest, his head and his rays.
// So from the whole avenue, the porch and the climb his head and rays stand against open sky on every visit.
