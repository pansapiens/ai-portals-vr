// boathouse-full-of-morning: A BLUE POLICE BOX ON A LAKE WHOSE DOORS LEAD ON TO A GARDEN, A SEA AND A FROZEN SEA UNDER
// A RINGED PLANET (round two, the lead's section G; ROUND FOUR: the hut is THE BLUE POLICE BOX, and wherever a name or
// a comment below still says "hut" it means that box). A great blue police box stands on a lake at the blue hour; its
// open doors lead into a walled garden in morning sun. The same box stands in a long basin at the head of the garden's
// cherry avenue; its doors lead on to a sea at sunset. The same box stands in a cove of an islet off the harbour; its
// doors lead on to the pack ice of a giant planet's ring under the stars. And out there the same box stands frozen
// into a floe, with the way out in its doorway. One builder function makes all four (the part file's buildHut and
// buildJetty: the same body, posts, panelled leaves, lit windows, sign bands, stepped roof and lamp, and the same plank
// landing; a lantern on the landings of the last three, never on the lake's); each place only dresses it.
// The hero is the crossing: three times the hut is seen whole and small, the lens flies in through its door, and the
// place beyond is of another kind, hour and colour.
// (The series is named in the module's header fields and nowhere else.)
//
// AXES: +x east, +y up, +z south. Metres. Bearings are compass bearings. Lake level y 0. The planes, the outlines, the
// line, the huts, the land and the berg massif are the same on every seed (the massif's three bergs draw their shards
// from fixed streams of their own, named for the massif as it now stands: MASSIF_WORDS); the seed deals the dressing,
// the boats' phases and the four bergs beside the ways in the stars (see FORKS OF THE SEED in build).
//
// THE THREE PLANES (src/parts/boathouse-full-of-morning.js, PLANES). EVERY OUTLINE IS THE HUT'S ARCH, the engine's own
// (the lead's rulings of 14 and 15 Oct): 6.4 m wide, 3.2 m either side of the line, its foot 2.7 m under the line (0.5 m
// under the hut's water line), straight jambs to a springing 1.4 m over the line, a half-round head of radius 3.2 m.
// The line passes each plane square, 2.2 m over the hut's water line.
//   PLANE ONE: z = 0, facing south; the line passes at (0, 2.2, 0); the water line is the lake's, y 0. Outer side: the
//     lake hut's water door. Inner side: a water gate of the same outline in a gatehouse of the garden's south wall.
//   PLANE TWO: z = -205, facing south; the line passes at (-22, 3.2, -205); the water line is the long basin's, y 1.0.
//     Outer side: the garden hut's water door. Inner side: a sea gate of the same outline at the foot of the harbour's
//     cliff.
//   PLANE THREE: upright through (98, 1.2, -304.7), its outward normal toward bearing 315; the line passes through it
//     on bearing 135; the water line is the sea's, y -1. Outer side: the islet hut's water door. Inner side: a plain
//     arch of pale stone of the same outline, standing alone on the ring's ice.
//   THE FLOOR PLANE: level, y = -5. The stars' place lies behind plane three and runs on SOUTH of plane two's whole
//     plane, under the garden's ground; there the three planes' sides alone cannot tell an eye in the stars from an
//     eye in the garden. Between planes one and two an eye over the floor plane stands in the garden, an eye under it
//     in the stars. One more fixed plane of the world, read by the eye's side of it and nothing else. WHAT THE LAW
//     ALLOWS THE STARS' LINE (round three, the lead's B4): north of plane two's plane (z < -205) the eye stands in the
//     stars by plane three's side alone, at any height; south of it only under the floor plane. So the line may rise
//     as it rounds the berg massif and must be under y -5 before it passes z -205. It goes under the floor plane soon
//     after plane three, rises a little over it only round the massif's east end, far north of plane two's plane, and
//     is well under it again before it passes plane two's plane on its last straight (layLine: the build stops if any
//     point of the line south of a metre short of that plane stands within a metre of the floor plane).
//
// THE CROSSING'S LAW, LINE 5, WORD FOR WORD:
//   WHAT DECIDES, AND WHAT NEVER DOES. Only which side of each fixed plane the eye stands on, and where each line of
//   sight crosses it: one test, the same in every material and in the skies, on every seed. Nothing goes by the clock,
//   by metres flown or by a fade. Which places are in the scene at all (the eye's place and its neighbours) goes by
//   the eye's side of the planes too, and a place is taken out only when no line of sight can reach it.
//
// HOW IT IS BUILT. One GLSL function, seenPlace (the part file), says in which place the far end of a sight line
// lies. Every material of the world comes from one helper (kit.mat) that writes that test as the last lines of its
// fragment shader: a fragment of place m stands only where the answer is m. The four skies are one dome whose every
// pixel draws the sky of the answer. Each place's sun, sky and air are its own, wherever it is seen from; a place's
// air is laid only over the part of a sight line that lies in that place. No scene.fog, no three.js light. Each
// opening's frame is the hut's own door case: it stands BEFORE its plane with its faces a millimetre inside the
// outline, so the edge one sees is the boards' own edge.
// WHICH PLACES ARE HANDED TO THE RENDERER: with the eye in place k, the places k-1, k and k+1 (by the eye's side of
// the planes, in update()); a neighbour is left out only while its one opening (the only window through which any of
// it can be seen) lies wholly beyond one of the four side planes of the eye's view. The near and the far plane are
// never asked (round three b, S6): a place stays in whenever a line of sight from the eye can cross its opening.
// THE LIGHT OF THE NEXT PLACE AT AN OPENING (the morning on the lake's water and on the hut's jambs; the sunset poured
// down the long basin and on the garden hut's jambs; the stars' cold light on the sea before the islet hut's door and
// on its jambs) is written from where the lit surface stands and how it faces, and never reads the eye. So is THE
// LANTERN's light, the same lantern on the jetties of the garden's, the sea's and the last hut (none at the lake's).
//
// THE WAY OUT (section 177): the engine draws it, as a rectangle 6.4 by 7.3 m, in the last box's open doorway, which is as
// wide (foot on foot, jamb on jamb; over its head, 6.8 m, the doorway shows the box's dark inside up to 12.8 m). This world sets NEITHER portal.drawWithin NOR portal.drawIn:
// the ring stands whole from the flight's first metre. From the lake, the garden and the sea up to its last ten metres it is
// never in a line of sight, because the water and ground of those places (opaque, written to depth) always stand
// between: its place lies at y -12.55 under them. IN THE SEA'S LAST TEN METRES, through the islet hut's door, it IS
// seen, small and far, in the door of the hut out on the ice: a hut in a hut's door, kept so by the owner's ruling 9;
// no berg, no floe, no ridge and no block stands in that sight. (Round three b: once through that door the line
// turns 45 degrees off that sight; rounds three c and d: the berg massif, its feet by the room that sight's strip and
// the line leave and its heights by the door it must hide, within the design's band for great bergs (MASSIF,
// massifHeights), hides the door from about 32 m in, and the whole hut a little farther in, where the sights from the
// line to all of the hut's points are shut; the door comes into view round the massif's east end, to the line's
// right, from about 79 m in, the whole hut a few metres farther on, and the last run is straight and low at its door.)
// Nothing of ours draws a ring, a growing lamp or an image of one, and no test of ours touches the engine's ring.
// The last hut is a body of the stars' place; behind its door, where the ring is not in sight, stands the hut's plain
// inside of tarred boards: back wall, roof timbers, an oar on pegs.
//
// WHAT MOVES, all of it on the world's clock and none of it because the visitor comes. Lake: ripples, reeds, the
// boats at the jetty, swifts, fireflies. Garden: the jets and the great jet, leaves, petals on
// the canal and the long basin, birds, butterflies (none nearer than 6 m), bees; in the second court the round pool's
// jets, cherry petals falling, crowns stirring, and over all of it the shadows of four clouds. Sea: a long swell, foam
// at the moles, the wall's foot, the stacks and the islet, moored boats rocking (the home-coming boat swinging to her
// chain at the buoy by the fairway), a fleet under sail with wakes (the second boat on a ring of its own), a far
// steamer, gulls, the two pierhead lights and the lighthouse flashing, the town's chimney smoke and lit windows, surf
// breaking at the islet's foot, clouds. Stars: the
// planet's bands and storms turning slowly, lightning on its night side, the ring's lanes running far out, ice dust,
// glints; THE PACK ICE IS STILL (round three, the lead's B3): its floes, its ridges and every block frozen into it
// stand where they are, and the last hut STANDS STILL in its floe.
//
// SOURCES (for the audit). The idea: the series' alone. The real world: tarred, turf-roofed boathouses of the north;
// English walled gardens of brick with a canal and jets, and parterres of box-edged beds; fishing harbours under a
// cliff, with moles, boat stores in the harbour wall and gaff-rigged luggers, and their towns of slate-roofed houses
// climbing the hill behind the quay in terraces with steps between; sea stacks; islets of layered rock with sea
// pinks on their turf; THE RINGS OF A GIANT PLANET, which are countless blocks of water ice from pebbles to houses in
// a sheet only tens of metres thick; and the pack ice of a polar sea in early winter: floes of 5 to 60 m, dark leads
// between them, pressure ridges of broken blocks where floes meet, great bergs frozen in. Ours: the chain,
// the planes, the line, the hut found four times. Public domain: none used. Brought in (section 181): one passage of
// the part file, named in its BROUGHT IN line at its head (three.js r170's filmic tone fit, MIT).

    //   heaps, the harbour's gulls, the gulls of the other stacks and the islet;  'town': each house's width, storeys,

    //   freeboard and tone, and where every block piled along the ridges lies, its size and turning.

    //   boat' (its phase on its ring and its rocking), 'home-coming boat' (its swing at the buoy and its rocking), 'great
    //   bergs' (the four bergs beside the ways, to round three d); and from round three c 'fleet' (the
    //   fleet under sail after the second boat: courses, hulls, sails, phases), 'ice dust' (the dust's spots and their
    //   sparks), 'gulls of the near stack'; and from round three e (the lead's R2) four streams in place of 'great
    //   bergs', one for each band of the bergs beside the ways, 'great bergs: ' and the band's name (BESIDE): the
    //   places, feet and heights of that band's throws, so that a band's tests move its own berg alone. Every berg
    //   beside the ways is dealt anew in round three e, on every seed.

    //   number (its site's number among the darts; 'ice plate 0' is the last floe's): the breaks of the plate's sides,
