// CAPTION, the owner's word of 9 Oct: Phidias made the seated god of ivory and gold over a wooden frame. The geographer Strabo wrote that his head almost touched the roof.
//
// The Statue of Zeus at Olympia: at dawn on a festival morning in high summer about AD 170. The flight begins inside the
// sacred grove north east of the temple, 13 m up over the stadium's road where it leaves the gate ground (the stadium's gate stands
// north of the long colonnade's end; the colonnade is 26 m and more from the lens), the sun low and gold behind and the white
// temple ahead with its east front and the long row of its north side: one wide first sight. After a few metres it leaves the
// road to the right hand and goes down at once, to 3.3 m over the ground, due west through an alley of wild olives and old planes,
// statues on their bases and pillars close on both hands, people in small knots among them, a small altar with a thin smoke where
// the alley ends, the ash altar's cone and its tall smoke ahead on the right between the planes' trunks, the temple on the left
// between the olives. It turns south out of the trees before the temple's north east corner and goes down the cross way's east
// half along the east front, the front squaring up, to head height at the ramp's foot; up the ramp, between the middle columns, through the porch with its three
// bronze gates and the great bronze door into the dim room, to the black pool of oil and slowly up before the seated god to the
// bay of the south gallery beside his right hand, where the ring stands. The statue is src/parts/zeus-at-olympia.js.
// Behind the entry the road runs straight back to the stadium's gate: nothing solid stands across that line.
//
// Axes: +X east, +Z south, y 0 the grove's ground. The temple's axis is z 0, its centre x 0, its door to the east.
// Daylight enters the room by the east door alone. The three.js sky light is the ROOM's dark fill; the open air's sky
// light is added by place in this world's own materials (zeusOpen below: 1 in the open, less under the colonnade,
// 0 in the room), so nothing but the sun's blade, two soft lights thrown up from the sunlit floor and the oil, and
// six small lamps finds the god above the knees.
//
// SAID IN THE OPEN (the owner's rule on places, 10 Oct): what is drawn, lit or placed by where the lens is, and why.
// - THE RING IS FIRST DRAWN where THE MOUTH OF ITS BAY OPENS TO THE LENS past THE BAY'S EAST UPPER COLUMN: the ring stands in the mouth of
//   the south gallery's bay, between that bay's two upper columns. Seen from far down the nave the east column closes the mouth; in plan,
//   the straight line from the lens to the middle of the mouth (half way between the two columns, on the line of their axes) clears that
//   column's shaft (its lower radius) from a place of the lens's line on (route.D.mouth), and from there the ring is drawn. The engine
//   then opens it about its own middle. The rule is the plan's alone: no picture, look, window or seed is read.
// - THE WAY IN IS TYPED BY THINGS THAT ALWAYS STAND (the road and its gate ground, the cross way, the temple's north east corner, the
//   ramp's foot: see WAY_IN) and is the same on every visit. DESIGN, SAID HERE, for the whole stretch from the entry to the ramp's foot
//   and for every seed (nothing below reads a place of the lens other than the line's own metres, nor a look, a clock or a seed):
//   . A LANE BY PLACE ALONG THE LINE: the grove's deal stays the deal by the seed, but no tree, statue, base, altar, standing person or
//     walker's beat is dealt nearer the line than its clear air (WAY_AIR, WAY_STATUE, WAY_ALTAR, WAY_FOLK, WAY_WALK; the lens's own
//     height there counted); a candidate that would stand in it is not dealt (dealGrove, dealLife).
//   . THE WAY'S TREES are placed to be seen from the way: thirteen trees (six old planes on the right hand, seven wild olives on both)
//     always stand beside its first run, the same shapes at the same places on every visit (WAY_TREES): the alley the lens flies down.
//     No plane's crown stands south of the sight from the entry to the temple's north west corner: the first sight keeps the temple whole.
//   . ROWS OF STATUES FACING THE WAY stand along both its hands (dealt by the seed from a stream of their own, 'statues-way-in': which
//     stand, of what kind, how far back): they are DENSER NEAR THE WAY than the grove's statues are far from it, and thin less with the
//     visit's density. ONE SMALL ALTAR with a thin smoke always stands on the right hand where the alley ends (its place along the line,
//     its size and turn by the seed; "always" is a RATE: OF THE LAW, the deal's 24 tries found it a place on 2,000 of 2,000 seeds
//     counted, 1 to 2,000: see dealGrove), and knots of people and walkers' beats are dealt beside the way (streams of their own).
//   . THE CLOSE VIEW: every statue of the grove is ONE MAKE (statueGeo: a carved figure of one of eight kinds, its head with a face's
//     planes, the paint of the age on marble, a sheen on bronze; on the bare bodies of the near and middle makes the forms are drawn by
//     the light from the body's own coordinates, a pure rule of the place on the body) at four finenesses BY THE PLACE IT STANDS AT: the NEAR make where the
//     lens passes within WAY_CLOSE (6.5 m) of it, the lens's own height counted; the MIDDLE make from there to WAY_MID (12 m); the FAR
//     make beyond; the FARTHEST where it stands farther than WAY_FAR (40 m) from every place of the way outdoors. (SINCE r5 THE FOUR
//     ARE NOT ONE FIGURE WITH FEWER FACES: step 4 gives the near make heads and limbs of its own and step 5 gives kind 6 a mantle
//     on the near and middle makes alone, so A KIND IS TWO FIGURES BY HOW NEAR THE WAY IT STANDS: see r5 step 4 and step 5 below.)
//     A base within WAY_MID has its mouldings, and a wreath or a garland of leaves is laid on a few of those. A standing person
//     within WAY_CLOSE of the line is modelled in the round; those farther than WAY_FAR are the plainest. WHAT THE NEAR THINGS GAIN,
//     THE FAR ONES GIVE UP. Detail by the place a thing STANDS at: the same on every visit, whatever the lens does. (THIS HOLDS OF
//     THE STATUES, THE BASES AND LIVE'S OWN PEOPLE. It does not hold of r5 step 10's people: each of them changes make by the
//     lens's distance in metres: see WHAT OF r5 READS THE LENS below.)
//   . THE BEATEN PATH under the way in is drawn in the ground (WAY_PATH): people have walked where the lens flies.
//   . THE PACE is quickest outdoors (PACE.grove as far as the top step) and slow from the great door on: more than half of the flight's
//     seconds are spent beyond the great door.
// - THE LOOK ON THE WAY IN is a law of places (makeRoute): at the entry the temple's north east corner column (the first sight); as the
//   lens goes down it turns toward the way ahead and, from before the alley's end, back to that corner, the two turns overlapping: the
//   gaze keeps on the temple's side of the line all the way down and through the alley and never swings round to due west and back (so
//   an arrival through a ring, at whatever speed it is carried in, turns under 30 degrees a second: 27.9 at the most with the sweeping
//   camera, 23.1 with the steady one, see the camera's spec); down the cross way's leg along the east front (the cross way's east
//   half, m 68 to 97; the ramp's foot is at m 107.95) it goes to the east front, and from the ramp's foot on it is the old look.
// - TWO INCENSE BURNERS stand before the barrier's blue faces, one on either side of the gateway, each before the middle of its face
//   (BURNER): placed to be seen from the nave, the same on every visit; their shade lies on the floor behind them and climbs the face.
// - WHAT MOVES moves by its own rule on the film's clock: nothing begins because the lens arrives, nothing is placed or timed for a
//   view. IN THE HALL: the six lamps' flames (each on its own phases; its light on the floor, the barrier and the gold breathes with it:
//   the six levels are handed to the part as opts.lampLevel); the incense (a thread from the small altar and from each burner, spent
//   under the beams, where what they have given hangs in two thin drifting sheets along the whole nave, over the crown of his head);
//   the oil's slow sheen and the swell that travels over it; the dust in the blade of sun and the lit air's own unevenness, from the
//   east front to his knees; the curtain's side spans; the still figures' slow shift of weight. OUTSIDE: the walkers, the leaves, the
//   kites and swallows, the altars' smokes and fires, the standing people's and the offerers' slow shift of weight, the hanging ends
//   of the woollen fillets tied round the altars and round one statue's base in three.
//   A MEDIUM THINS TO NOTHING NEAR THE LENS (the dust, the incense's threads, the smokes): from 2.5 m down to 0.6 m of true distance,
//   at every place and on every visit.
// - WHAT IS LEFT UNDRAWN BY THE LENS'S PLACE (each hides only what cannot be in the picture; see WHAT IS LEFT UNDRAWN, 1 to 4, in build):
//   1 the oil and its mirror picture while the curtain before the barrier hides the whole of the oil from the lens; 2 the grove and the
//   far land while the lens is inside the room (a plain stand-in of the land lies beyond the open door); 3 the god while the lens is
//   outside the room and no straight line from it through the great door's opening can reach him; 4 a part of the grove (east or west
//   of PART_X; the near and middle statues by cells of 16 m) whose own box lies wholly outside the picture.
// - THE LOOK INDOORS is a law of things and places (makeRoute): his shins as far as the barrier, then up his body to his face over the
//   closed floor; up the rise it slides from his face half way to the bay's mouth (reached where the lens is level with the gallery's
//   floor) and turns on to the bay's mouth on the last straight. There is no look down at the pool.
// - r5 AS BUILT (13 Oct, with the readers' mends of the first freeze; each said below): IN are step 1 (the room), 2c (the sun taken
//   away once), 4 (the near statues' forms), 5 (the robed man with the palm: no longer a switch), 6 (the ring opens by place), 7
//   (the forms let go by the pixel's width), 10 a, b, c (life where the pictures were empty, its knots by THE RULE OF THE KNOT)
//   with C1 (the make by the lens's distance, BY METRES), C2 (the shade of a body on open paving) and C3 (the two makes' one
//   dress). Steps 2a, 3 and 9 were tried and are NOT IN (the last lines of this head). Nothing in the world is lettered.
//   EVERY COUNT BELOW SAYS ITS KIND: OF THE LAW (the deal and the makes read as numbers, no picture) or OF THE PICTURE (counted in
//   the drawn page), and its seeds. A count OF THE LAW on seeds 1 to 200 is taken with the visit's variation as the page deals it
//   from the seed (with a plain visit the figures are others). A count of seeds or of places is a RATE, no law of the form.
//   OURS, NOT THE RESEARCH'S (the research names no kinds of statue, says nothing of their heads and lists the grove's ways as
//   unknown): the statues' EIGHT KINDS, their THREE HEADS BY KIND (step 4), THE ROBED MAN WITH THE PALM (step 5), that the way
//   the lens flies is kept free by live's deal (a rule of ours, no ancient custom: see lifeSteps), and step 10's walkers who
//   climb the temple's three steps beside the ramp (the research gives the ramp as the way up). THE DESIGN'S FILE as this
//   round found it (design/sw/briefs/zeus-at-olympia.json) carries no word of r5: its kinds and heads, its counts of people and
//   its distances are of earlier rounds, and its nearest standing person was counted in the picture; r5's clear air below is
//   OF THE LAW, not of the picture.
//   SECTION 177: the world sets portal.drawWithin and portal.drawIn; it shows no light and no image of its ring (the pool's
//   mirror takes layer 1 alone, on which the world sets only things of its own; nothing of the world takes the ring's colour).
// - r5 step 1, THE ROOM BOUGHT FIRST: the statues' MIDDLE, FAR and FARTHEST makes are thinned (statueGeo: each thinned figure stands
//   in a thin(was, now) marked "r5 step 1"; R5_STEP1 false gives those three makes as they were, kind 6's but for step 5). The near make and every statue's place, kind,
//   tone and size are as they were. MIDDLE (the lens never nearer than 6.5 m): the head 8 columns by 6 rings for 10 by 7, the bare
//   trunk 8 columns round for 10, an arm 4 sides for 5. FAR (never nearer than 12 m): the head 5 columns by 4 rings for 6 by 5, the
//   bare trunk 4 rings for 5, an arm 3 sides for 4. FARTHEST (40 m and more): the head 2 rings for 3, the bare trunk 3 rings for 4,
//   an arm that hangs straight 2 places for 3. Legs, hands, feet, garments, bands, wreaths and things held are as they were.
// - r5 step 2c, THE SUN'S LIGHT IS TAKEN AWAY ONCE (zeusOnce, R5_STEP2C, for the whole world and every seed): the painted shade keeps
//   three kinds apart (the buildings', the trees', the statues' and people's). On the ground and on every body, what a building has
//   shaded no other shadow darkens further: in a building's full shade (it leaves R5_DEEP of the sun) the place keeps exactly that
//   share; in its half shade a second shadow takes the rest of the sun and no more; in the sun everything is as it was. So inside the
//   long colonnade's shadow the ground under a tree is as light as the open ground there, a body under a crown as light as a body
//   beside it, and a statue's shadow shows only where the sun reaches. The shade's own depth and colour are as they were; no light is
//   added. (Within one kind the painted picture still lays shadow on shadow: a crown is a sieve of many leaves.) R5_STEP2C false: as
//   it was (the ground took the darkest of the three, a body the trees' share times the buildings').
//   THE STEPS' WALKERS' GROUND STRIP (step 10; r5 A5) stands partly outside this rule: on the ground east of the lowest step's
//   foot it takes the painted shade as every other painted shadow does (what a building or a tree has shaded there it darkens
//   no further); ON THE STEPS IT TAKES NO SHADE (there the painted shade holds the temple's own footprint and would take the
//   strip whole); and THE MAP'S SHADOWS CUT NO PAINTED STRIP, this one or another, on the steps or on the ground before them:
//   where a shadow of the map lies (a standing body's shadow board), a walker's strip darkens the place once more.
//   THE FIRST METRES' SHADE IS THE LONG COLONNADE'S OWN: the ground the lens looks down on from the entry (m 0 to 12, the strip 8 to
//   40 m ahead) lies in the shadow that the long colonnade behind it throws at this sunrise: the long colonnade (the research's
//   long Echo Stoa; its length, height and place are the design's) under the design's sun, neither touched; the building stands
//   on every seed. COUNTED, OF THE LAW (the painted shade read as the world paints it for the seed, no picture), on the six
//   seeds 7, 14, 37, 128, 162 and 195, RATES OF PLACES: 92 places in 100 of that strip have under half the sun, 82 by the
//   colonnade, 5.5 by the trees alone. So no tree was moved for it, and by 2c no second shadow darkens that ground further.
// - r5 step 4, THE NEAR STATUES' FORMS (R5_STEP4 and R5_AIR at statueGeo; the near make alone, no statue moved, none added, no
//   triangle added): the shoulder falls from the neck over a round cap into the arm; thigh, calf, upper arm and forearm swell; three
//   heads by kind (the victor's, a youth's, a bearded man's: OURS; planes only: no eyeball, no worked lips, no likeness; the near
//   heads carry a face's planes as live's do). THE NEAR MAKE ALONE, SO A KIND IS TWO FIGURES BY HOW NEAR THE WAY IT STANDS: within
//   WAY_CLOSE (6.5 m) of the line kind 3 is bearded and kinds 2 and 4 have cropped hair and no band; beyond it kind 3 is beardless
//   and kinds 2 and 4 wear the band, as live's do. A statue's make is by its place, so none changes in flight.
//   IN SHADE THE FORMS STILL READ, by a rule of the surface's own turn and of the sun's bearing (the seed's): what of a near statue
//   faces the sun's side of the sky takes R5_AIR.side more of the air's light, what faces away as much less, and a furrow of the
//   body's forms R5_AIR.furrow less. The side share reads nothing of the lens, the way or the clock. THE FURROW SHARE READS THE
//   PIXEL'S WIDTH: it is cut with the forms themselves by step 7's filter (statueMat's zBk), so it fades with the lens's
//   distance and the window as they do.
// - THE BODY'S FORMS LET GO WHERE A PIXEL IS WIDER THAN A FURROW (r5 step 7; statueMat's zBk): the plates and furrows the light draws on
//   the near and middle statues' bare bodies stand at full strength where a pixel is under 0.8 cm of the surface wide and are gone
//   where it is 2.2 cm and more: a filter by the pixel's own width against shimmer, the one filter through which those forms, and
//   step 4's furrow share with them, read the lens.
// - r5 step 5: THE ROBED MAN WITH THE PALM (statue kind 6; he was the charioteer in the long belted robe; step 5 is no longer a
//   switch: the charioteer's branch is out of this file) is OURS. The earlier robed kind answered to one surviving kind of work in
//   all six of the choices that described it; two of the six are changed so that it answers to no one work: for the high belt,
//   the belt AT THE WAIST in every make and a mantle with body over the left shoulder and upper arm on the near and middle
//   makes; for the forearm held to the reins, both arms LOWERED in every make and a palm in the right hand: a frond on the
//   near and middle makes, one blade on the far make, none on the farthest. Four are kept: he stands alone, the long robe in
//   upright folds, the short sleeves, the band round the hair. A palm in a victor's right hand is the lead's own knowledge of
//   ancient custom, not in this world's research. He goes on the design's list of ours. See statueGeo.
// - r5 step 6: THE RING OPENS (portal.drawIn, R5_STEP6) over the metres of the line from where its bay's mouth opens to the lens
//   (route.D.mouth, where it is first drawn) to the pool's east edge (route.D.pool): typed as the difference of those two places.
// - r5 step 10, LIFE WHERE THE PICTURES WERE EMPTY (R5_STEP10, R5_STEP10C, LIFE10, KNOT10 and GROUND10 at lifeSteps; rules of place
//   for every seed, dealt from streams of their own after the rest of the deal, which does not move: live's deal stands to the bit):
//   (a) ON THE EAST FRONT people of the world's own makes stand in the gaps between the columns to either hand of the ramp, on the
//   steps beside it and the ground before them, along the ramp's two edges and in the porch to the sides of the great door, and a
//   few walk up and down the steps beside the ramp on closed beats. THE DOOR'S LANE STAYS OPEN: none of them stands nearer the
//   temple's axis than 3.0 m on the ramp and 3.3 m from the top step to the door (the lane between the nearest bodies' middles is
//   6.0 m and 6.6 m wide, over a door 5.0 m wide); none stands in the room. THE RAMP HOLDS EIGHT AT MOST (LIFE10.ramp: every
//   one on it is in the round and in the god's first frame; OF THE PICTURE, seed 75: with the ramp unbounded that frame drew
//   492,195 triangles, over the lead's term of 492,000).
//   (b) UNDER THE ENTRY people stand and walk on the stadium's road from 8 to 60 m past the entry, none nearer the lens's line than
//   WAY_CLOSE (each place is tested against the line, the lens's height counted).
//   (c) ON THE GROUND BEFORE THE TEMPLE knots of two to four stand on the open ground below the east front north of the ramp and
//   past the temple's north-east corner (GROUND10.fields; none nearer the temple's axis than 7.4 m, and none nearer the lens's
//   line in plan than WAY_CLOSE: each place is tested against the line), and walkers go on closed beats toward the ramp's foot.
//   THE RULE OF THE KNOT (r5 A1; of step 10's people alone: live's own knots are dealt as they were, to the bit, and may still
//   stand in a row): a knot is two to four people in a loose ring or arc with unequal gaps. Each is turned by a draw of its own:
//   to the knot's middle, to the knot's sight (the great door; for two of the porch's places a thing of the porch; for (b) and
//   (c) the temple's front) or half away; one who would be the third of its knot turned alike is turned on. Off the ramp NO THREE
//   STAND ON ONE LINE (KNOT10.line, off; for (a) live's offerers are counted with them). ON THE RAMP'S EDGES a knot is a file of
//   two or three with unequal gaps; KNOT10.edge (2.5 m) of free edge lies between two knots of one edge; the knots of the two
//   edges do not stand opposite one another (KNOT10.across); EACH EDGE HOLDS A THIRD OF THE RAMP'S PEOPLE AND MORE. NO MIRROR, NO
//   TWIN: each takes its dye, its mantle's dye, its skin and hair and what it holds from draws of its own, and none wears the
//   dye or holds the thing of a neighbour within KNOT10.twin (2.5 m) of its place or of its mirror place across the temple's
//   axis. COUNTED, OF THE LAW, seeds 1 to 200: no line of three among step 10's people and the offerers; no file of more than
//   three on an edge of the ramp; no edge under a third; the least free edge between two knots 2.90 m; no two such neighbours
//   in one dye or holding the same thing; no three of a knot turned alike within KNOT10.alike.
//   THE CLEAR AIR IS A RULE (section 169: 2.0 m, its margin 2.3 m). (b) and (c) are dealt WAY_CLOSE (6.5 m) and more off the
//   line. One of (a) whose make's greatest reach in plan (reach10: 0.36 m at rest; 0.54 to 0.78 m with the arm held out, bare or
//   with a wreath, a dish or a branch in the hand) would come within KNOT10.air (2.3 m) of the lens's line is not placed (r5
//   A2). COUNTED, OF THE LAW, seeds 1 to 200, against the lens's place as flown from the entry to 6 m past the door (both
//   cameras fly that line and only turn): of (a) the least is 2.923 m to the body's axis and 2.623 m to a post of 0.30 m about
//   it; of the 3,485 people in the round, 2.458 m to the TRUE CORNERS of the round make as it stands and 2.367 m with its
//   shift of weight taken whole (none under 2.3 m; two under 2.5 m). Of (b) 6.626 m and of (c) 6.451 m to the post; the
//   walkers' beats 9.463 m (those of the steps that are drawn: beatNear leaves out every one whose beat comes within WAY_CLOSE
//   of the line in plan), 6.674 m (b) and 7.088 m (c).
//   THE COUNTS A SEED (OF THE LAW, seeds 1 to 200, the visit's variation as the page deals it: the least / the mean / the most):
//   (a) 19 / 27.9 / 38 standing (of them on the ramp 3 / 7.1 / 8), 11 / 17.4 / 22 of them in the round, and 0 / 2.0 / 4 walkers
//   of the steps dealt, 0 / 0.7 / 2 of them drawn; (b) 8 / 15.2 / 23 standing and 1 / 2.0 / 2 walkers; (c) 14 / 17.6 / 20
//   standing and 1 / 2.4 / 3 walkers. In all 47 / 60.7 / 74 stand, beside live's 110 / 170.6 / 244.
// - WHAT OF r5 READS THE LENS, NAMED HERE (section 153 of the crews' rules; nothing of it reads a look, a clock or a seed): one is
//   A LEVEL OF DETAIL BY METRES FROM THE LENS, one a filter by a pixel's width, one a timing by the lens's place on the line; the
//   others leave out what cannot be seen.
//   . DRAWN BY THE LENS'S DISTANCE, BY METRES (step 10's own, under no switch; r5 C1, R5_C1, adds the round make to it): each of
//     step 10's people is live's standing figure or walker in the knots' make while the lens is within LIFE10.far (40 m: WAY_FAR's
//     figure typed again) of him and in the plainest make beyond. THIS IS NO FILTER BY A PIXEL'S WIDTH: it is 40 m from the lens
//     in metres, the same at every window and lens angle: a level of detail by where the eye is, changed on one frame with no
//     fade; a law by the eye under section 153, named here as that. LIVE NEVER HAD IT: live's makes are by the place a thing
//     stands at and never change in flight (its plainest make is by the body's distance from the way, this one by the lens's:
//     unlike rules). NOW, ON EVERY VISIT, a person of step 10 changes make in flight on the frame where the lens comes within
//     40 m of him. One who STANDS nearer the lens's line than WAY_CLOSE (the ramp's edges, the top step's inner gaps, the porch)
//     is live's figure in the round (fineFigureGeo, dressed from his own dealt draws: kind10, held10; its arm one tube through
//     the elbow, o.join) while the lens is within 40 m of him, and the plainest make beyond: by the body's place and the lens's
//     distance. With R5_C1 false the change at 40 m stands and only the round make goes.
//     THE TWO MAKES WEAR ONE DRESS (r5 C3): the plainest make of a long garment carries its mantle as the round one does (rolled
//     across the chest to the left shoulder, over the left arm, its end behind) in the mantle's own dye (aDye2), so that the
//     change at 40 m moves no DYE OF GARMENT OR MANTLE. Skin, hair and what is held still change there: the plainest make's skin
//     and hair are the make's own and the round make's are the person's; the wreath, the staff and the offering are in the
//     round make alone; the head's shape and the limbs' roundness change.
//   . NOT DRAWN OUTSIDE THE PICTURE: one of step 10's people whose ball (1.5 m about his middle) lies wholly outside the picture
//     is not drawn (the renderer's own test of a thing out of the picture, made a body at a time).
//   . THE WALKERS LEFT OUT NEAR THE LINE (beatNear): the world has no walker in the round, so a walker of the steps whose beat
//     comes nearer the lens's line in plan than WAY_CLOSE (one that climbs through a gap next to the ramp) is not drawn on any
//     frame of any visit; its beat stays dealt and kept free, so that nothing else of the deal moves. By the beat's place alone.
//     (OF THE LAW, seeds 1 to 200: 269 of the 400 walkers of the steps dealt are left out.)
//   . BY THE PIXEL'S WIDTH: step 7's filter on the statues' bodies, and step 4's furrow share through it (both named above).
//   . TIMED BY THE LENS'S PLACE ON THE LINE: the ring's opening (step 6: over the metres from route.D.mouth to route.D.pool, two
//     places of the world and the line; no seed, no still).
//   . PLACED BY THE LINE'S PLACES, NOT BY THE LENS IN FLIGHT (rules of place, the same on every frame of every visit): who is
//     made in the round, which walkers are left out, (b)'s and (c)'s test against the line, and (a)'s by its make's reach (A2).
// - THE SHADE OF A BODY ON OPEN PAVING (r5 C2, R5_C2; the 'pave' material: steps, ramp, its side walls): where the sun's map of
//   shadows shades paving that lies open to the sky, half of the sky's upper light is taken from it and half of the lower, warm light
//   given, by the surface's own turn upward, so that the shade has the tone of the side walls' shaded faces there and is neither
//   brighter nor bluer than it; under the roof (the roof's edge by zeusOpen's four figures, typed again in paveShade) nothing is changed. A rule of the
//   surface and of the map alone: nothing of the lens, the way or the clock is read. The front people's unseen shadow boards have
//   a neck and a head (a body's outline, not a tapered slab).
// - THE ROOM AS BUILT (OF THE PICTURE: counted in the page at 320 x 180, on the two seeds 14 and 75 alone; the budget is 500,000
//   triangles and 200 draw calls, the lead's term 492,000 triangles): on seed 14 the flight's first frame draws 489,156 triangles
//   in 193 calls and the god's first frame (m 82.1) 481,069; on seed 75 they draw 481,969 in 192 calls and 491,072, the heaviest
//   frame found on those two seeds. No rule of the code bounds a seed's triangles as a whole; step 10's people are bounded by
//   LIFE10 (front, ramp, ground). The god in the kept map of shadows (step 9) does not fit in it.
// - WHAT r5 NO LONGER SHOWS, AND WHAT IS NOW SEEN BY CHANCE:
//   NEVER NOW: the charioteer (kind 6) in any make; within WAY_CLOSE of the line the band on a youth's hair (kinds 2 and 4) and
//   a beardless kind 3 (beyond it both are as live's).
//   NEVER ON LIVE, NOW ON EVERY VISIT: a person of step 10 changes make in flight where the lens comes within 40 m of him.
//   BY CHANCE NOW, where live never had it: on the last turn before the ramp's foot (m 96.9 to 107.9) one of (a) may stand
//   before part of the great door's opening. COUNTED, OF THE LAW, seeds 1 to 200 (the reader's own count run on this deal:
//   bodies as posts of 0.30 m, 25 marks of the opening, the line every half metre): at 1,296 of 4,600 places, on 169 seeds of
//   200, RATES (at the worst 6 marks of 25); from the ramp's foot to the door at none of 15,600 places.
// - THREE THINGS OF r5 WERE TRIED AND ARE NOT IN (nothing of them is left in this file):
//   step 2a (the first plane moved to frame the first pictures): the alley's right hand row is that wall already; nothing seen was gained.
//   step 3 (a body cut by the picture's foot on the way in moved outward): six strangers of six preferred live's fuller foreground (the paper: shots/zeus-at-olympia/r5-previews.txt).
//   step 9 (the god in the kept map of shadows): on the map's frame he is drawn twice (794,836 triangles); a ghost left his feet's shade unlike.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- THE STATUES' ONE MAKE: a carved figure of one of eight kinds, at one of four
// finenesses (lv 0 the near make, 1 the middle, 2 the far, 3 the farthest: see WAY_CLOSE, WAY_MID, WAY_FAR. They are no longer one
// figure with fewer faces: since r5 step 4 the near make has heads and limbs of its own, so A KIND IS TWO FIGURES BY HOW NEAR THE
// WAY IT STANDS: within WAY_CLOSE kind 3 is bearded and kinds 2 and 4 wear no band, beyond it they are beardless and banded; and
// kind 6's mantle is on the near and middle makes alone). Height 1.75 m over its feet (the boy less), facing +x, inside 0.42 m of
// its upright axis and under 1.95 m (the clear air's own cylinder in the deal). THE EIGHT KINDS ARE OURS (the research names no
// kinds of statue): 0 one who binds the band round his head, 1 one with
// a palm branch, 2 one with a discus at his side, 3 one who scrapes himself, 4 a jumper with his weights, 5 a boy with his hand raised
// to his wreath, 6 a man in a long robe belted at the waist with a palm branch (r5 step 5: he was a charioteer), 7 a draped man,
// bearded, his cloak's folds falling to a hem over the feet.
// THE HEAD is a sculptor's blocking: skull, the hair as a mass of short locks with a hairline, a band or a wreath, the brow's ledge, the
// nose's ridge, the eye hollows (no eyeballs), cheeks, one soft fold for the mouth, chin and jaw, ears as low forms, a neck that widens
// to the shoulders; each kind's head turned or bowed its own way (THE HEADS ARE OURS: the research says nothing of the statues'
// heads; a face's planes, no eyeball, no worked lips, no likeness). THE BODY: shoulders broader than the hips, chest and belly as forms,
// the weight on one leg, the other knee eased and the hips tilted, elbow, wrist, a hand with a thumb. Nothing is lettered.
// It carries for each vertex aPaint (0 the body, 1 hair, 2 band or wreath, 3 a garment, 4 a garment's border, 5 the thing held) and
// aHollow (0 to 1: how deep in a hollow it lies); statueTint turns these into its colours. The near and middle makes also carry THE
// BODY'S OWN COORDINATES on the bare trunk, the bare legs and the bare arms (aBody: which part (1 the trunk, 2 a leg, 3 an arm; 0 none:
// a garment, the head, a hand, a thing held, and all of the far makes), the cosine and the sine of how far round the part (0: its front;
// a leg's sine grows to its inner side; an arm's 0 is the inside of the elbow's bend), how far up it (the trunk and a leg: metres over
// the feet at the figure's own scale; an arm: 0 the shoulder, 1 the elbow, 2 the wrist)): the statues' material draws the body's forms
// from them by the light (zbForm). Where an arm or a thigh comes out of the bare trunk its normals are carried over from the trunk's,
// so that the shoulder's cap and the hip flow into the trunk under the light and no ball reads at the joint (no vertex moves).

// stands nearer the body and lower, and two of the arm's rings shape the shoulder's cap (the ring half way down the forearm, which
// lay on the straight line from elbow to wrist, is the second of them), so that from the front the outline falls from the neck over
// the cap into the arm with no shelf and no corner. THE LIMBS SWELL: the rings of thigh, calf, upper arm and forearm are ovals, deeper
// than broad, and stand off the limb's line where the muscle lies (the thigh forward and outward, the calf back and inward, the
// forearm's mass by the elbow). THREE HEADS BY KIND (OURS; planes only: no eyeball, no worked lips, no likeness): the VICTOR'S (kinds 0, 1, 5, 6: full hair that the
// band or wreath presses in), A YOUTH'S (kinds 2 and 4: short hair close to the skull, low over the brow and cropped at the nape,
// a narrower jaw, NO BAND), A BEARDED MAN'S (kinds 3 and 7: a higher brow, a heavier brow ledge, the hair long over the nape, a full
// beard that hangs under the chin). The near make alone is changed: so kind 3 is bearded, and kinds 2 and 4 are bandless, within
// WAY_CLOSE of the line only (see the head). IN SHADE: see R5_AIR. R5_STEP4 false: the near make is as it was, to the bit (kind 6's but for step 5).

// long robe belted high; upright folds like flutes below the belt; short sleeves; a forearm held out to the reins; a victor's
// band round the hair) answered, all six, to one surviving kind of work. TWO are changed so that the kind answers to no one work:
// for the high belt the robe is belted AT THE WAIST in every make, and a MANTLE lies over the left shoulder and upper arm on the
// near and middle makes (r5 A3); for the forearm held to the reins both arms are LOWERED in every make, and the right hand holds a
// palm: a FROND on the near and middle makes (r5 A3), one blade on the far make, none on the farthest. Four are kept. A palm in a
// victor's right hand is the lead's own knowledge of ancient custom, not in this world's research.
// r5 step 4, FORMS THAT STILL READ IN SHADE (the near make alone; a rule of the surface's own turn and of the sun's bearing, which the
// seed deals; nothing of the lens or the clock): the air's light is not the same from all sides at sunrise: the half of the sky where
// the sun stands is the brighter. What of a near statue faces the sun's bearing takes R5_AIR.side more of the air's light, what faces
// away as much less (its mean is as it was: no light is added), and a furrow of the body's forms takes R5_AIR.furrow less of it (it
// sees less sky). In the sun the sun's own light rules as before; in shade the forms now turn from light to dark across the body.
